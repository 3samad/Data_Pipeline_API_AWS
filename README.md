# Data_Pipeline_API_AWS

This is a data engineering project during my DS Bootcamp created using BeautifulSoup (to collect information about cities and their populations), APIs (to collect information about airports, weather forecasts and flight arrivals), MySQL and automated with AWS-Lambda Functions. 

I invite you to read this Medium Article to gain insight into the entire process of this project.
